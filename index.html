        <p>COVID-19 has brought more people in the New York area into contact with seals, and it can be a problem for both species.</p>


        <p>Impressive beach crowds and high numbers of seals flocking to Staten Island and the Rockaways have led to increased seal encounters during the pandemic, according to local animal rehabilitation organization, the New York Marine Rescue Center.</p>

        <p>“A lot of our seals were at normal beaches that would be less populated,” said Rescue Program Director, Maxine Montello. “But because of COVID and everybody coming out here earlier in the year, we had patrons that maybe had never crossed with seals and were super interested in these animals.”</p>


        <p>The Rescue Center has responded to its highest number of calls for seals involving human interaction in a decade, with a high number coming in from Long Island and the Rockaways. In 2020, the Rescue Center investigated 16 human interaction cases, an increase of 45% from last year’s total. Seven of these cases involved direct harassment.</p>

        <p>After a lull of cases in 2012, numbers started to climb in 2013, with an increase of 433% over the past 7 years.</p>
